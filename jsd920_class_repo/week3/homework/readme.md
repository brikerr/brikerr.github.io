### Assignment Due on Tuesday, 10/11:

* Create a sequencer that allows users to add files into its 'storage bank' to play them and customize when they are triggered. The user will be able to create patterns within a predefined 'grid' composed of 16 steps that will signify an 'on' state and 'off' state. These states are controlled by the user tapping on the squares (or steps) as they want to customize the pattern.

* The user can drag and drop audio wav files into each 'grid' section within a specified 'target area' to change out the sounds that are being triggered. Changing the pattern and sounds files can happen in real-time as the sequencer is running.

#### Optional
* Reading Chapter 6: [The Secret Life of Objects](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html) of Eloquent JS
